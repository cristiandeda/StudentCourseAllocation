- project developed during the Object-Oriented Programming course in my second year at *University Politehnica of Bucharest*, *Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers*.

- this projects implements a system for *managing* and *assigning* students to *optional university courses*.

### Description

- The project models the `Student` class (a parent class for `StudentLicenta` and `StudentMaster`), as well as the `Curs` and `Secretariat` classes. The `Secretariat` class contains the necessary methods for implementation, serving as the interface through which the `main` function interacts.

- Used `HashMap` collections to store all created students and courses (both undergraduate and master's level).
    - `HashMap` was chosen due to its key-value structure, making it easier to retrieve a `Student` or `Curs` object by name.

- Every command is implemented *successfully*, as described in the task.
